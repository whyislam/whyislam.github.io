claimed that the Injeel we have today is not corrupt as opposed to what the Muslims often say. In this page, we will attempt to give a response to his claim.</p><h2 id=injeel>Injeel<a href=#injeel class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>Muslims indeed believe in the Gospels (Injeel) and the Torah (Turah) as what Sir Fouad Marsi claimed. The reason why most of us say that the Injeel is corrupt or have been changed follows from the fact that what we have today is not the original Gospels that God have revealed. So, when we say that we believed in the Injeel and the Torah, we are referring to the original texts revealed by God.</p><h2 id=author-of-the-christian-gospels>Author of the Christian Gospels<a href=#author-of-the-christian-gospels class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>The Christian Gospels we have nowadays were written by scribes who are actually unknown. Though we refer to them as the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, these are names made to conveniently refer to the books but they are not necessarily the names of the authors. The following are the summary from Oxford Bible Study:</p><table class=table-striped><thead><tr><th>Page</th><th style=text-align:center>Gospel</th><th style=text-align:left>Authorship</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1781</td><td style=text-align:center>Matthew</td><td style=text-align:left>&ldquo;&mldr; most scholars hold that the author/editor is someone other than the disciple Matthew (even if, as here, he is referred to as Matthew out of convenience)&rdquo;</td></tr><tr><td>1829</td><td style=text-align:center>Mark</td><td style=text-align:left>&ldquo;Mark was written anonymously. The designation &lsquo;according to Mark&rsquo; was added in the second century CE, as Gospels began to circulate beyond audiences for whom they were written.&rdquo;</td></tr><tr><td>1865</td><td style=text-align:center>Luke</td><td style=text-align:left>&ldquo;By the second century, the author of the Gospel and its sequel, the Acts of the Apostle, was identified as Luke, a physician who was a travelling companion and co-worker with Paul&mldr; Yet, even defenders of the traditional identification recognize difficulties with that connection.&rdquo;</td></tr><tr><td>1917</td><td style=text-align:center>John</td><td style=text-align:left>&ldquo;Like the other Gospels, this one never names an author. Since at least the late second century CE, tradition has attributed the authorship of the Gospel to Jesus&rsquo;s desciple, John the son of Zebedee&mldr; Today most scholars think that Johannine traditions stem from an unidentified follower of Jesus, not one of the twelve disciples.&rdquo;</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=scope-of-the-injeel>Scope of the Injeel<a href=#scope-of-the-injeel class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>As Sir Fouad Marsi mentioned, the Injeel refers to the Book revealed to Jesus (peace be with him). Therefore, the scope is only the Gospels of Jesus (peace be with him) and does not include the writings of Paul. Since the writings of Paul was not revealed to Jesus (peace be with him), rather Paul&rsquo;s writings were letters to different regions such as Romans, Corinthians, etc. Nonetheless, we respect those who have different opinions, where they refer to all of the New Testament as Injeel.</p><h2 id=the-bible-is-god-breathed>The Bible is God-breathed<a href=#the-bible-is-god-breathed class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>The Bible in general as what the Christian claims is god-breathed. Hence, it cannot be considered corrupt as what the Muslims suggest. If a book is considered god-breathed, it means that the writings is inspired by God. So when the anonymous author of the Christian Gospel wrote the texts, they are indeed inspired by God. This is what Paul claimed in the following:</p><div class=bible-wrapper><div class=bible-verse><div class=bible>πᾶσα γραφὴ θεόπνευστος καὶ ὠφέλιμος πρὸς διδασκαλίαν, πρὸς ἐλεγμόν, πρὸς ἐπανόρθωσιν, πρὸς παιδείαν τὴν ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ,</div><div class=translation>All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness</div></div><div class=bible-verse-no><div class=book>Bible (NRSV)</div><div class=chapter>2 Timothy</div><div class=chapter-verse>3:16</div></div></div>At this point, I would like to align ourselves to this idea of "god-breathed." We are all aware that God is perfect, and if He gave us a book with His "god-breathed," or we can think of it as godly inspired, then we should expect a perfect book, consistent from its grammar, to its paragraph structure, and especially to its teaching.<h2 id=selected-contradictions>Selected Contradictions<a href=#selected-contradictions class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>A book with contradictions is not god-breathed, since God cannot contradict Himself from one book to another. It only suggest that the Bible have been changed or that the authors were not inspired at all. We&rsquo;ve selected only a few here, but we can list more.</p><h3 id=ot-contradictions-on-names>OT: Contradictions on Names<a href=#ot-contradictions-on-names class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h3><p>While the topic here is about the New Testament, we include the Old Testament&rsquo;s contradiction since Christians believed that 2 Timothy applies to all scriptures they believed in.</p><ul><li><b>Who was Shelah's father?</b><table class=table-striped><tbody><tr><td><b>Genesis 11:12</b> (NRSV) When <b>Arpachshad</b> had lived thirty-five years, he became <b>the father of Shelah</b>;</td></tr><tr><td><b>Luke 3:35-36</b> (NRSV) the son of Serug, son of Reu, son of Peleg, son of Eber, <b>son of Shelah, son of Cainan</b>, son of Arphaxad, son of Shem, son of Noah, son of Lamech,</td></tr></tbody></table>Both Genesis and Luke are referring to the same Shelah. If we read the broader genealogy we have:<table class=table-striped><thead><tr><td>Verses</td><td>Genealogy (NRSV)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genesis 11:10-16</td><td>Noah > Shem > <b>Arpachshad</b> > Shelah > Eber > Peleg</td></tr><tr><td>Luke 3:35-36</td><td>Noah > Shem > Arphaxad > <b>Cainan</b> > Shelah > Eber > Peleg</td></tr></tbody></table>From the flow, we can see that the father of Shelah is Arpachshad in Genesis, but Cainan in Luke. Some Bible versions refer to Arpachshad and Arphaxad to the same person, but in NRSV the Hebrew name is transliterated as Arpachshad. This could be differences in Hebrew (in Old Testament) and Greek (in New Testament) transliteration mapping.<br><br></li><li><b>Who was Basemath's father?</b><table class=table-striped><tbody><tr><td><b>Genesis 26:34</b> (NRSV) When Esau was forty years old, he married Judith daughter
of Beeri the Hittite, and also Basemath <b>daughter of Elon the Hittite</b>.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Genesis 36:3</b> (NRSV) and Basemath, <b>Ishmael's daughter</b>, sister of Nebaioth.</td></tr></tbody></table>These verses refer to the same woman, the wife of Esau. In fact, Genesis 36:2 even claims that Elon the Hittite was the father of Esau's other wife Adah.</li></ul><h3 id=ot-contradictions-on-numbers>OT: Contradictions on Numbers<a href=#ot-contradictions-on-numbers class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h3><ul><li><b>How many supervisors or foremen did Solomon have?</b><table class=table-striped><tbody><tr><td><b>1 Kings 5:16</b> (NRSV) besides Solomon's <b>three thousand three hundred supervisors who were over the work</b>, having charge of the people who did the work.</td></tr><tr><td><b>2 Chronicles 2:2</b> (NRSV) Solomon conscripted seventy thousand laborers and eighty thousand stonecuttters in the hill country, with <b>three thousand six hundred to oversee them</b>.</td></tr></tbody></table></li><li><b>How old was Ahaziah when he began to reign?</b><table class=table-striped><tbody><tr><td><b>2 Kings 8:26</b> (NRSV) Ahaziah was <b>twenty-two years old</b> when he began to reign; he reigned one year in Jerusalem.

He unfortunately did not show us evidences on the contradictions of the Christian Injeel.</p><ul><li><b>Had the ruler’s daughter died or was she just really sick?</b><table class=table-striped><tbody><tr><td><b>Matthew 9:18</b> (NRSV) While he was saying these things to them, suddenly a leader of the synagogue came in and knelt before him, saying, "My daughter has <b>just died</b>; but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live."</td></tr><tr><td><b>Mark 5:23</b> (NRSV) and begged him repeatedly, "My little daughter is <b>at the point of death</b>. Come and lay your hands on her so that she may be made well, and live."</td></tr><tr><td><b>Luke 8:42</b> (NRSV) for he had only daughter, about twelve years old, <b>who was dying</b>.</td></tr></tbody></table>While the daughter eventually died in all accounts of Christian Gospels, the contradiction is what was said first to Jesus (peace be with him), Matthew says dead already, while Mark and Luke say at the point of death. We know that, dead has no soul while at the point of death still has a soul, and it has a difference.<br><br></li><li><b>When did the disciples notice the withered fig tree?</b><table class=table-striped><tbody><tr><td><b>Matthew 21:19-20</b> (NRSV) And seeing a fig tree by the side of the road, he went to it and found nothing at all on it but leaves.

You see that faith was active along with his works and faith was brought to completion by the works.
