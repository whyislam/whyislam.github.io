Accordingly, it requires an offering in order to be forgiven since this is the practice of the Jews in the Old Testament.
Blood Sacrifice Blood sacrifice is required for the forgivenss of the sin as suggested by the following verses in the Old Testament:
כִּ֣י נֶ֣פֶשׁ הַבָּשָׂר֮ בַּדָּ֣ם הִוא֒ וַאֲנִ֞י נְתַתִּ֤יו לָכֶם֙ עַל־הַמִּזְבֵּ֔חַ לְכַפֵּ֖ר עַל־נַפְשֹׁתֵיכֶ֑ם כִּֽי־הַדָּ֥ם ה֖וּא בַּנֶּ֥פֶשׁ יְכַפֵּֽר׃ For the life of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given it to you for making atonement for your lives on the altar; for, as life, it is the blood that makes atonement.</description></item><item><title>Crucifixion</title><link>https://getdoks.org/christianity/crucifixion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Nov 2020 14:27:39 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://getdoks.org/christianity/crucifixion/</guid><description>The atonement of sins are done by human sacrifice, accordingly, sacrificing a sinless human who is Jesus (peace be with him).
