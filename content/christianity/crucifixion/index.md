The atonement of sins are done by human sacrifice, accordingly, sacrificing a sinless human who is Jesus (peace be with him). This act of human offering to God is referred to as the crucifixion. Below is the verse from the book of John detailing part of the crucifixion event.

      ὁ οὗν πιλᾶτος ἀκούσας τῶν λόγων τούτων ἤγαγεν ἔξω τὸν ἰησοῦν, καὶ ἐκάθισεν ἐπὶ βήματος εἰς τόπον λεγόμενον λιθόστρωτον, ἑβραϊστὶ δὲ γαββαθα. ἦν δὲ παρασκευὴ τοῦ πάσχα, ὥρα ἦν ὡς ἕκτη. καὶ λέγει τοῖς ἰουδαίοις, ἴδε ὁ βασιλεὺς ὑμῶν. ἐκραύγασαν οὗν ἐκεῖνοι, ἆρον ἆρον, σταύρωσον αὐτόν. λέγει αὐτοῖς ὁ πιλᾶτος, τὸν βασιλέα ὑμῶν σταυρώσω; ἀπεκρίθησαν οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς, οὐκ ἔχομεν βασιλέα εἰ μὴ καίσαρα.

      and carrying the cross by himself, he went out to what is called The Place of the Skull, which in Hebrew is called Golgotha. There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, with Jesus between them.
