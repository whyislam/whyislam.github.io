Since all mankind are sinners coming due to the original sin, it requires an atonement in order to be forgiven by God the Father. Accordingly, it requires an offering in order to be forgiven since this is the practice of the Jews in the Old Testament. 
## Blood Sacrifice
Blood sacrifice is required for the forgivenss of the sin as suggested by the following verses in the Old Testament:

    <div class="bible-hebrew">
    כִּ֣י נֶ֣פֶשׁ הַבָּשָׂר֮ בַּדָּ֣ם הִוא֒ וַאֲנִ֞י נְתַתִּ֤יו לָכֶם֙ עַל־הַמִּזְבֵּ֔חַ לְכַפֵּ֖ר עַל־נַפְשֹׁתֵיכֶ֑ם כִּֽי־הַדָּ֥ם ה֖וּא בַּנֶּ֥פֶשׁ יְכַפֵּֽר׃ 
    </div>
    <div class="translation">
      For the life of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given it to you for making atonement for your lives on the altar; for, as life, it is the blood that makes atonement.
    </div>

  </div>

Further, a good offering should be a sinless being. Accordingly, since all of us are sinners, only Jesus (peace be with him) can satisfy the requirements for a good offering since he is sinless. This is the core teaching of St. Paul who wrote most of the later books in te New Testament. For example, in his letter to Romans:
<div class="bible-wrapper">
  <div class="bible-verse">
    <div class="bible-hebrew">
    τὰ γὰρ ὀψώνια τῆς ἁμαρτίας θάνατος, τὸ δὲ χάρισμα τοῦ θεοῦ ζωὴ αἰώνιος ἐν χριστῶ ἰησοῦ τῶ κυρίῳ ἡμῶν.
    </div>
    <div class="translation">
      For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
