In the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy. Let me begin with the sincerest
intention all for the sake of truth. Assalamu 'Alaikum! (peace be upon you!)

The life of Jesus (peace be with him) plays a pivotal role to both Christianity and Islam. 
The two religions believed Jesus (peace be with him) as the Messiah sent by God to the children of Israel. 
His divinity is the core belief of the majority of the Christian denominations around the world, 
but is rejected by the Qur'an (the holy book of Islam). <b>So the main question is, is Jesus (peace be with him) God?</b>

This page aims to provide a brief overview of Christianity as a religion.

## Nature of God
Christianity can be categorized into two major groups: Unitarian and Trinitarian. The former follows the belief that God is 
One and that Jesus (peace be with him) is not a God but is the Messiah. The latter, on the other hand, believed Jesus (peace be with him) as the Messiah
and is a God, and follows the doctrine of Trinity which states that, the Father, the Son --- Jesus (peace be with him) --- and the Holy Spirit are Gods, co-equal, distinct and are one.

Trinitarians justify the concept of the Trinity through verses like Genesis 1:26 and Matthew 28:19. Further, they also justify the divinity of Jesus (peace be with him) through the miracles depicted in the New Testament, and through the statement "I am" from John 8:58, which they say is a fulfillment of the Exodus 3:14.

Unitarians, on the other hand, justify their claim of Oneness of God through verses like Deuteronomy 6:4, Isaiah 45:5-6, etc. In addition, they also support this with New Testament verses like John 17:3, Mark 12:28-34, etc.

## Original Sin
Trinitarian Christians emphasizes heavily on the role of sin. In particular, they believe in the concept of Original Sin, which states that we are all sinners because we inherited this from our first ancestor, Adam and Eve (may peace be with them), who committed the first sin. This sin, accordingly, is present from the day we were born, and can only be removed through atonement.

## Law
Christians justify their belief by emphasizing that the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:1-17) that was given by God the Father are difficult to put into practice. No one can put it into practice without having shortcomings on some of the items in the commandments. These shortcomings are then sins, since having shortcomings means not fulfilling the items, making everyone a sinner. These sins then can only be removed by atonement.

## Atonement of Sins
Sins can be atoned through blood sacrifice only, according to Trinitarians. This is the ruling, accordingly, in the Old Testament (see Leviticus 17:11). Moreover, in order to atone all the sins of all humankind, someone should sacrifice a blood. Not blood of the animals, but someone who is sinless. According to Trinitarians, only Jesus (peace be with him) was appropriate for the job. Thus, the crucifixion, accordingly, meant to do just that --- to atone all of us.

## Crucifixion
The crucifixion of Jesus (peace be with him), accordingly, is an act of obedience of Jesus (peace be with him) to his Father. Sacrificing himself for all sins of humanity, which in turn makes us all righteous, or have a ticket already to get close to God the Father, who is the Most Righteous.

## Denominations
Christianity has the most number of denominations among all other religions. It started with Catholic, then splitted to Protestant, then within Protestants there were several further splits. One key emphasis on the belief of the Trinitarian Protestant is that, they justified their belief from the fact that <i>righteousness is not based on work but based on faith</i> (<i>see</i> for example Philippians 3:9), which is not emphasized by the Roman Catholics, accordingly.

## Holy Books
The Holy Books used by the Christians, is the Bible, consisting of the Old Testament and the New Testament. The said compilation of books were written by either Prophets and Writers, who were divinely inspired, accordingly. The Old Testament is used by the Christians as reference for the fulfillment of their claims in the New Testament.

## Practice
The difference between Christian denominations can arise from the Nature of God, like Trinitarian or Unitarian. However, some key differences are seen in their practices, like in worship, in food (eat pork or not?), in dressing, in Christmas (celebrate or not?), in day of sabbath (Saturday or Sunday?), etc.

## St. Paul
St. Paul is by far the most popular Christian convert, his writings are heavily used as reference by Christians. Most Christians nowadays are referred to as Pauline Christians, since the other movement in the early days of Christianity, such as Nazareth Christians, Gnostic Christians, etc. were considered heretics and was overwhelmed by the popularity of the Pauline teachings.
