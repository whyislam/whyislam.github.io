The concept of Original Sin is defined by the event where both Adam and Eve (peace be with them) ate the forbidden fruit. This is the first sin committed by mankind and this became the basis of the Original Sin of Christianity, since the sin committed are extended up to the fourth generation, whose sins are also extended to succeeding four generations, respectively. In this case, all human beings becomes sinners.

## The temptation by the serpent
The first sin in which Adam and Eve (peace be with them) committed is depicted from the following verses where Eve was tempted by the serpent:

      Now the serpent was more crafty than any other wild animal that the Lord God has made. He said to the woman, "Did God say, 'You shall not eat from any tree in the Garden'?" The woman said to the serpent, "We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden; but God said, 'You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the garden, nor shall you touch it, or you shall die.'" But the serpent said to the woman, "You will not die; for God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil." So when the woman saw that the three was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate; and she also gave to her husband, who was with her, and he ate. Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made lioncloths for themselves.

      You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, punishing children for the iniquity of parents, to the third and fourth generation of those who reject me.
