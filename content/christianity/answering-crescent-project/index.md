Sir Fouad Marsi have claimed that the Injeel we have today is not corrupt as opposed to what the Muslims often say. In this page, we will attempt to give a response to his claim.

## Injeel
Muslims indeed believe in the Gospels (Injeel) and the Torah (Turah) as what Sir Fouad Marsi claimed. The reason why most of us say that the Injeel is corrupt or have been changed follows from the fact that what we have today is not the original Gospels that God have revealed. So, when we say that we believed in the Injeel and the Torah, we are referring to the original texts revealed by God.

## Author of the Christian Gospels
The Christian Gospels we have nowadays were written by scribes who are actually unknown. Though we refer to them as the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, these are names made to conveniently refer to the books but they are not necessarily the names of the authors. The following are the summary from Oxford Bible Study:
|     Page   |    Gospel   |   Authorship |
|------------|:-----------:|:-------------|
|    1781    |   Matthew   | "... most scholars hold that the author/editor is someone other than the disiple Matthew (even if, as here, he is referred to as Matthew out of convenience" |
|    1829    |    Mark     | "Mark was written anonymously. The designation 'according to Mark' was added in the second century CE, as Gospels began to circulate beyond audiences for whom they were written." |
|    1865    |    Luke     | "By the second century, the author of the Gospel and its sequel, the Acts of the Apostle, was identified as Luke, a physician who was a travelling companion and co-worker with Paul... Yet, even defenders of the traditional identification recognize difficulties with that connection." |
|    1917    |    John     | "Like the other Gospels, this one never names an author. Since at least the late second century CE, tradition has attributed the authorship of the Gospel to Jesus's desciple, John the son of Zebedee... Today most scholars think that Johannine traditions stem from an unidentified follower of Jesus, not one of the twelve disciples." |

## Coverage of the Injeel
As Sir Fouad Marsi mentioned, the Injeel refers to the Book revealed to Jesus (peace be with him). Therefore, the scope is only the Gospels of Jesus (peace be with him) and does not include the writings of Paul. Since the writings of Paul was not revealed to Jesus (peace be with him), rather those were letters to different regions such as Romans, Corinthians, etc. Nonetheless, we respect those who have different definition, where Injeel includes all of the New Testament.

## New Testament is God-breathed
The Bible in general as what the Christian claims is god-breathed. Hence, it cannot be considered corrupt as what the Muslims suggest. If a book is considered god-breathed, it means that the writings is inspired by God. So when the anonymous author of the Christian Gospel wrote the texts, they are indeed inspired by God. This is what Paul claimed in the following:
